# simple-life

This is my final project building a DApp for Kingsland University. It's an outline of a potential future DApp. I'm open to working with people who are more knowledgeable in this space and have more experience with best practices when it comes to building DApps. Enjoy!

The front end is inside the client folder. I also put it on Netlify as simple-life-project.netlify.app. I haven't made it mobile accessible. Currently it only works on laptop/desktop.
